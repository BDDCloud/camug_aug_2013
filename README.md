#Getting Started

##Requirements

* Recommend the use of a ruby version manager (such as [RVM](https://rvm.io/))
* Clone this repository (I recommend cloning it to a path without spaces)
* Navigate to the cloned repo folder in your shell
* Run the following commands:
  - . ./cenv
  - ./run_first
  - ./start_new_exercise

* Verify that everything is working by running the tests:
  - bundle exec ruby proofs/suite.rb 
  - You should see output similar to the following:
